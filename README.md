# Amazon_Vine_Analysis: Major Appliances

## Project Overview
The goal of this analysis was to determine if there was any bias in major appliance reviews that were written as part of the Vine program. In particular, did having a paid Vine review make a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews? 

## Results
Note that only reviews with at least 20 votes, of which more than half were helpful, were analyzed. 

The results of the analysis for Vine program participants and non-participants were as follows:

![not_vine_reviews](/not_vine_reviews.png).
* There were substantially more reviews from non-participants, 4,957, than Vine program participants, 35.
* Among Vine program participants, 18, or 51.4 percent, were five-star reviews. Among Vine program non-participants, 1,963, or 39.6 percent, were five-star reviews.  

## Summary
The results suggests that there may be bias among Vine program participants reviewing major appliances. It is difficult to say with confidence, however, that a bias exists because of the small number of reviewers participating in the Vine program compared to program non-participants. To increase confidence, consider waiting for more major appliance reviews or comparing the results from this analysis to the results from two or three more Amazon review data sets.
