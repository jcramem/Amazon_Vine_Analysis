# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Project Overview
The goal of this analysis was to determine if there was any bias in reviews that were written as part of the Vine program. In particular, did having a paid Vine review make a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews? 

## Results
Note that only reviews with at least 20 votes, of which more than half were helpful, were analyzed. 

The results of the analysis for Vine program participants and non-participants were as follows:

![not_vine_reviews](/not_vine_reviews.png).

* There were substantially more reviews from non-partipcants, 4,957, than Vine program parctipants, 35.
